# Overview

Andromeda is a minimalist one-page marketing theme styled with Tailwind CSS. The repository provides two reference implementations:

- **frontend-11ty**: a static-site build powered by Eleventy with Tailwind-generated CSS.
- **frontend-react**: a Vite-based React port that mirrors the Eleventy pages and styling.

The layout includes sections for hero, services, portfolio, team, and contact information, along with dark-mode support and subtle animations. Use either implementation as a starting point for landing pages or small marketing sites.
